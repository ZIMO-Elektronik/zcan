:::info

East/West direction can't be changed with this command.
It can be changed with [Vehicle special function switch](./vehicle-special-function-switch.md)

:::

## Receiving

When receiving command _0x02_ the 'Data' section will look like this:

| NID    | Speed and direction | Divisor |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| 16 Bit | 16 Bit              | 8 Bit   |


If Mode = 0b00, then the speed of the locomotive is requested with 'NID'. <br/> If M = 0b01, then the speed of the
locomotive is set to the transferred value with 'NID'. <br/> If M = 0b11, then the locomotive responds with 'NID' to the
request for its speed. <br/> Speeds are always sent with 10 Bit, in the upper 6 Bit additional Flags are sent. The
respective conversion into rail format is done in the TSE. The 'Divisor' value indicates a shunting divisor (e.g.: /2 or
/4) for a finer shunting resolution.

### Speed and direction flags

:::note
For all track formats, the maximum ZIMO speed is 1008.  Values > 1008 are automatically set to 1008.
