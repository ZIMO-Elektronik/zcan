## Receiving and sending commands

There are a few things to watch out for when receiving and sending orders. First, this is what the received message will look like. Also when sending, the message must be in the same format as the received message and the mode will be **0b01**.

| Size   | Unused | Group | Cmd + Mode                                | NID    | Data        |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| 16 Bit | 16 Bit | 8 Bit | 8 Bitfirst half = cmd  second half = mode | 16 Bit | 0 ... x Bit |


:::note

In every group the 'Data' section is used for further parsing of information! <br/> When receiving the message everything will be in byte version! <br/> When creating the message everything has to be changed to byte version!

## Command group table

Every message contains group code for better handling of commands. All commands are grouped in the following groups:

| Group                                                       | Code | Use/Content                                                                                               |
